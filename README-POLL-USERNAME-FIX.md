# Poll Username Fix

This update fixes the issue where usernames were showing as "Anonymous User" in the polling results.

## What's Changed

1. Updated the `submitPollResponse` function in `src/lib/supabase.ts` to save the Clerk username when a user votes
2. Updated the `getDetailedPollResults` function to use the stored username directly from the poll_responses table
3. Added an admin tool to update the database schema to include the new fields
4. Created SQL functions to add the necessary columns to the poll_responses table

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Deploy Code Changes

Deploy the code changes to Vercel. The main files changed are:

- `src/lib/supabase.ts`
- `src/lib/fixDatabase.ts`
- `src/app/admin/fix-database/page.tsx`

### 2. Add SQL Functions to Supabase

To add the required columns to the poll_responses table, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to the SQL Editor
3. Create a new query and paste the contents of `scripts/add_poll_response_columns.sql`
4. Run the SQL query to create the functions

### 3. Update Database Schema

After deploying the code and adding the SQL functions:

1. Log in to your application as an admin
2. Go to `/admin/fix-database`
3. Click the "Update Poll Responses Table" button
4. Verify the operation was successful

### 4. Test Voting

After making these changes, test the voting system:

1. Go to an announcement with a poll
2. Cast a vote
3. Check the admin view to confirm the username is properly displayed instead of "Anonymous User"

## Note on Existing Votes

Existing votes will still show as "Anonymous User" since they were cast before this update. Only new votes will include the username.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the database update:

1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Verify the SQL functions were created correctly in Supabase
3. Make sure your application has the correct permissions to alter tables
