i wanna  making a platform adaptable to all semesters and users across EPU is a smart move, especially if youâ€™re thinking about scalability and making it useful for future students. Here's a **clear step-by-step plan** for how to update your platform to support multiple semesters and show personalized dashboards based on the selected semester.

---

## âœ… **Goal**

Let each student select their **current semester on registration**, then display **semester-specific content** like courses, announcements, files, polls, etc., based on that.

---

## ðŸ§  Step-by-Step Plan

### 1. **Update the Database**

Add `semester` field to your `users` table.

#### âž• Migration Example:

```sql
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN semester INTEGER DEFAULT 1;
```

---

### 2. **Update the Registration Flow**

#### ðŸ”¹ Option 2: Custom form

Create a component like `SemesterForm.tsx`, similar to how you did with `GenderForm.tsx`.


---

### 3. **Modify Dashboard Logic to Filter by Semester**

Fetch user info (including `semester`), and filter courses, announcements, and presentations by semester.
---

### 4. **Update the Course, Announcement, Poll Tables (If Needed)**

Add a `semester` column to those tables too if the content is semester-specific.

```sql
ALTER TABLE courses ADD COLUMN semester INTEGER DEFAULT 1;
ALTER TABLE announcements ADD COLUMN semester INTEGER DEFAULT 1;
ALTER TABLE polls ADD COLUMN semester INTEGER DEFAULT 1;
ALTER TABLE Presentatn griup ADD COLUMN semester INTEGER DEFAULT 1;
```

And set it when creating content.

### 5. **Admin Panel Enhancements**

Allow admins to **create content per semester** â€” maybe add a dropdown to choose the semester when creating:

* Courses
* Announcements
* Polls
* Presentation sections
